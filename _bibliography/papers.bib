abstract = {Abstract On the Island of Samos (East Aegean region, Greece), two sedimentary basins are filled by thick continental series dated to the Late Miocene to Early Pliocene. A multidisciplinary study has been performed including (1) the definition of 21 sedimentary facies, (2) a review of the biological components and (3) carbon, oxygen and strontium stable isotope analyses. The succession is characterised by various depositional settings and hydrochemical compositions. Five main stages of basin evolution have been identified: (1) The Late Serravallian is marked by the development of alluvial fans and fan delta; (2) during the Lower Tortonian, isolated shallow lakes with variable salinity, from fresh to brackish, developed under warm and relatively humid conditions; (3) the Middle to Upper Tortonian is marked by the development of a large and deep lake with saline and alkaline waters, under colder and drier conditions; (4) the Latest Tortonian to Messinian period is represented by an ephemeral alluvial system, developed under a dry climate; (5) during the Zanclean, a palustrine and paludal wetland system, dominated by tufa carbonates, developed under moderately humid conditions. This succession is of particular interest for the reconstruction of the palaeoenvironmental evolution of the transition zone between the Mediterranean domain, and the Paratethys and circum-Paratethys areas. The geochemical data and the presence of flora (diatoms) and fauna (gastropods) of marine affinity suggest transient ingressions of marine-related water or groundwater inflows as early as the Lower Tortonian. The Samos succession records the complex interaction between the regional geodynamics and climate. The extensional regime of the Eastern Aegean zone generates subsidence, interrupted in the mid-Tortonian (9 Ma) by a brief compressive event and a major exposure of the basins. Furthermore, the Late Miocene progressive aridification, followed by a change to a more humid climate (Pliocene) is also a major driver of the sedimentation.},

     abstract = {The forced oscillation method is widely used to investigate intrinsic seismic wave dispersion and attenuation in rock samples by measuring their dynamic stress–strain response. However, using strain gauges to locally measure the strains on samples surfaces can result in errors in determining the attenuation and moduli of rocks with mesoscopic scale heterogeneities. In this study, we developed a 3-D numerical model based on Biot's poroelastic theory to investigate the effect of strain gauge location, number and size on attenuation and dispersion in response to wave-induced fluid flow. Our results show that increasing the strain gauge length, number, and size can reduce the error between local and bulk responses. In a homogeneous and isotropic rock with a quasi-fractal fluid heterogeneity at 12 per cent gas saturation, the relative error between local and bulk responses stays below 6 per cent when the strain gauge length surpasses 8.6 times the correlation length. As the gas saturation becomes larger, the ratio minimally changes non-monotonically, initially increasing and then decreasing. We also used the Monte Carlo method to demonstrate that local laboratory measurements can approximate the reservoir-scale response with a minimum relative error of 1.5 per cent as the sample number increases. Our findings provide guidance for (i) interpreting local low-frequency measurements in terms of bulk properties of rock and (ii) upscaling lab measurements to reservoir-scale properties.},

abstract = {Numerous experimental studies show significant differences between the static and dynamic elastic moduli of rocks. These differences are commonly attributed to the presence of cracks and uncemented grain contacts that make rocks non-linear elastic materials with a sensitivity to strain amplitude. To investigate the impact of strain amplitude on the bulk modulus of different rock types, we performed hydrostatic oscillations to induce strain amplitudes from 10–6 to 10–4 on the samples at frequencies ≤ 0.04 Hz. In addition, we measured the dynamic bulk modulus from ultrasonic wave velocities and the static bulk modulus from hydrostatic pressure ramps. In five out of the six samples, we observe a transition from the dynamic to static modulus with increasing strain amplitude. With increasing effective pressure, the bulk moduli increase, and the strain amplitude dependence is reduced. In the oolitic Chauvingy limestone, in contrast, we observed neither a significant strain nor effective pressure dependence on the bulk modulus, which is interpreted as the absence of pre-existing cracks. In the reservoir carbonate samples, for strain amplitudes > 5 × 10–5 the stress–strain loops become non-linear hysteretic and the measured attenuation plateaus. The presence of additional harmonics in the strain and the absence of harmonics in the stress, indicate that the non-linearity is inherent to the samples. The transition from dynamic to static bulk modulus is explained at first order by slip at grain contacts.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
