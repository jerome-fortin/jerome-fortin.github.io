   abstract = "Low‐frequency forced‐oscillation methods applied to a reservoir sandstone allowed determination of the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio (from axial loading), bulk modulus (by oscillation of the confining pressure) and shear modulus (from torsional‐forced oscillations) for comparison with conventional ultrasonic data. All tests were performed on a common sandstone core sample from an oil reservoir offshore West Africa. The results show a steady increase in ultrasonic velocities and shear modulus of the dry specimen as functions of pressure, which suggests a progressive closure of the inter‐granular contacts. An increase of bulk and Young's moduli and Poisson's ratio is observed on decane saturation of the sample when tested with a sufficiently small dead volume. This observation, consistent with Gassmann's theory, suggests that such measurements probe undrained (saturated isobaric) conditions. Diminution or absence of such fluid‐related stiffening for low‐frequency measurements with dead volumes comparable with the pore volume of the specimen indicates partially drained conditions and highlights the critical role of experimental boundary conditions. Directly measured bulk and shear moduli are consistent with those derived from Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. These results of the inter‐laboratory testing using different measurement devices are consistent in terms of the effect of frequency and fluid saturation for the reservoir sandstone specimen. Such broad consistency illustrates the validity of forced‐oscillation techniques and constitutes an important benchmarking of laboratory testing of the elastic properties of a porous medium.",

abstract = {Quantitatively assessing seismic attenuation caused by fluid pressure diffusion (FPD) in partially saturated rocks is challenging because of its sensitivity to the spatial fluid distribution. To address this challenge we performed depressurization experiments to induce the exsolution of carbon dioxide from water in a Berea sandstone sample. In a first set of experiments we used medical X-ray computed tomography (CT) to characterize the fluid distribution. At an equilibrium pressure of approximately 1 MPa and applying a fluid pressure decline rate of approximately 0.6 MPa per minute, we allowed a change in saturation of less than 1\%. The gas was heterogeneously distributed along the length of the sample, with most of the gas exsolving near the sample outlet. In a second set of experiments, at the same pressure and temperature, following a very similar exsolution protocol, we measured the frequency dependent attenuation and modulus dispersion between 0.1 and 1,000 Hz using the forced oscillation method. We observed significant attenuation and dispersion in the extensional and bulk deformation modes, however, not in the shear mode. Lastly, we use the fluid distribution derived from the X-ray CT as an input for numerical simulations of FPD to compute the attenuation and modulus dispersion. The numerical solutions are in close agreement with the attenuation and modulus dispersion measured in the laboratory. Our approach allows for accurately relating attenuation and dispersion to the fluid distribution, which can be applied to improving the seismic monitoring of the subsurface.},

abstract = {Abstract To test theoretical models of modulus dispersion and dissipation in fluid-saturated rocks, we have investigated the broadband mechanical properties of four thermally cracked glass specimens of simple microstructure with complementary forced-oscillation (0.004–100 Hz) and ultrasonic techniques (~1 MHz). Strong pressure dependence of moduli (bulk, Young's, and shear), axial strain, and ultrasonic wave speeds for dry conditions attests to essentially complete crack closure at a confining pressure of 15 MPa—consistent with ambient-pressure crack aspect ratios ≤2 × 10−4. Oscillation of the confining pressure reveals bulk modulus dispersion and a corresponding dissipation peak, near 0.002 Hz only at the lowest effective pressure (2.5 MPa)—attributed to the transition with increasing frequency from the drained to saturated-isobaric regime. The observations are consistent with Biot-Gassmann's theory, with dispersion and dissipation adequately represented by Zener model. Above the draining frequency, axial forced-oscillation tests show dispersion of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, and an associated broad dissipation peak centered near 0.3 Hz, thought to reflect local “squirt” flow and adequately modeled with a continuous distribution of relaxation times over two decades. Observations of Young's and shear moduli dispersion and dissipation from complementary flexural and torsional oscillation measurements for differential pressure ≤10 MPa provide supporting evidence of the transition with increasing frequency from the saturated-isobaric to the saturated-isolated regime—also probed by ultrasonic technique. These findings validate predictions from theoretical models of dispersion in cracked media and emphasize need for caution in the seismological application of laboratory ultrasonic data for cracked media.},

abstract = {Pore pressure has a major influence on the effective stress and thus on the mechanical behaviour of rocks. In this study, we focus on the hydro-mechanical behaviour of a low porosity andesitic rock heat-treated to 930 °C to induce thermal cracks and increase the permeability of the samples. First, we show that permeability decreases from 8 × 10−16 m2 to 1.5 × 10−17 m2 with a confining pressure (Pc) increase from 2 MPa to 40 MPa (pore pressure being approximately 0.2 MPa). Then, we used fibre optic pressure sensors to monitor pore pressure diffusion at three points along the sample during the propagation of a pore pressure pulse under hydrostatic (Pc=40 MPa) and triaxial stresses (Pc=40 MPa, differential stress of 356 MPa). When the pore pressure pulse was applied, the fibre optic sensors showed a sudden pore pressure increase one after the other as a function of their location along the sample. Pore pressure increase downstream was very smooth under hydrostatic stress and almost zero after the duration of the experiment (50 min) under triaxial stresses. This lack of downstream pore pressure increase under triaxial stresses is due to the fact that a differential stress of 356 MPa decreased permeability from approximately 10−17m2 to approximately 10−19m2. Finally, the pore pressure diffusion process was modelled considering a uniform spatial distribution of permeability in the andesite sample and the dead volume attached at the downstream side.}

abstract={A saturated Bleurswiller sandstone, of 25% porosity, was compacted by increasing the confining pressure over the critical pressure P* which characterizes the onset of pore collapse and grain crushing. The frequency-dependence of Young’s moduli were measured before and after the compaction using forced-oscillation method in a triaxial cell. For the intact and compacted samples, we observed one dispersive transition within the seismic band (0.01–100 Hz). The dispersion is consistent with crack-to-pore squirt flow, making the transition from the relaxed to the unrelaxed fluid-flow regime. The induced compaction shifted the critical frequency of the squirt-flow dispersion towards higher frequencies, thus moving it out of the seismic band and allowing Biot-Gassmann to fully apply. This result is a consequence of an increase in the crack aspect ratio after compaction. In addition, the dispersion of elastic modulus after compaction increases from about 25 to 30%, related to the increase of crack fraction.},

    abstract = "{Studies on the mechanical behaviour of rocks, including volcanic rocks, usually seek for unaltered and simple material: rocks without macroscopic defects. However, volcanic rocks are often naturally altered due to the circulation of hydrothermal fluids. This alteration may influence mechanical and physical properties. Here, we study the effect of hydrothermal alteration on the elasticity and failure properties of andesite. A homogeneous block of natural andesite was retrieved from a quarry. Three samples were first heat-treated and then artificially altered at different temperatures by soaking them in a brine for one month at a pressure of 20 MPa and temperatures of 80, 180 and 280 °C. Heat-treated unaltered and altered samples were hydrostatically loaded up to 50 MPa and unloaded, while strains and elastic wave velocities were recorded. Samples were also triaxially deformed to failure at a constant strain rate and a confining pressure of 15 MPa. At ambient pressure, increased alteration temperature resulted in increased wave propagation velocity, thus increased dynamic elastic moduli. During hydrostatic loading, volumetric deformation at a given effective pressure decreased with alteration temperature denoting increased static elastic moduli. During triaxial loading, the degree of alteration decreased elastic compaction and peak stress at failure. These observations are interpreted as the result of microcracks in-filling by alteration minerals, and in particular smectite, a swelling-clay mineral with a low friction coefficient. The mechanical behaviour of a volcanic rock subjected to triaxial loading was modelled with a damage model based on crack propagation from pre-existing flaws. A decreasing friction coefficient within the flanks of the cracks leads to a decrease of the peak stress and explains the experimental observations.}",

Second, we reproduce at the scale of the laboratory the complete spectrum of rupture velocities observed in nature. Our results show that the rupture velocity can range from a few millimetres to kilometres per second, depending on the available energy at the onset of slip, in agreement with theoretical predictions.

abstract = {Abstract The variation of the seismic properties with frequency of a brine-saturated sandstone sample with a porosity of 22\% was measured using a forced oscillation apparatus. Two pairs of orthogonal biaxial strain gauges were pasted at different locations at the length center of the sample. In the frequency range of 1–300 Hz, using these two pairs of strain gauges, we observed experimentally the same global flow but different local flows (squirt flow). Therefore, the observation of the local flow is influenced by the position of the strain gauges in contrast to the global flow. Indeed, local flow is strongly influenced by the microstructure (structure of the grain contacts and microcracks). In particular, we show that although the sample is homogeneous in terms of porosity and crack density, it is not the case in terms of crack aspect ratio, which may slightly vary along the sample. A 3D diffusion model coupled with a simple squirt model was built to further interpret the data. These results show that the wave-induced fluid flows occur at different scales and controls the dispersion and attenuation of saturated rocks.},

Using thirteen years of groundwater level observations, we highlight clear permeability variations induced by earthquakes in an aquifer and overlaying aquitard. Dynamic stresses, above a threshold value PGV > 0.5 cm s−1, were mostly responsible for these variations. We develop a new model using earth tides responses of water levels between earthquakes. We demonstrate a clear permeability increase of the hydrogeological system, with the permeability of the aquifer increasing 20-fold and that of the aquitard 300-fold over 12 years, induced by fracture creation or fracture unclogging. In addition, we demonstrate unprecedented observations of increase in permeability due to the effect of extreme tropical deluges of rainfall and hurricanes. The water pressure increase induced by the exceptional rainfall events thus act as piston strokes strong enough to unclog congested fractures by colloids, particles or precipitates. Lastly, an analysis of regional permeabilities also highlights a permeability increase over geological timeframes (× 40 per million years), corroborating the trend observed over the last decade. This demonstrates that permeability of aquifers of andesitic volcanic islands, such as the Lesser Antilles, significantly evolve with time due to seismic activity and extreme rainfall.},

abstract = {Continental carbonates are characterized by multi-scale heterogeneous porous networks, making the geological interpretation of seismic imaging difficult. We investigate two sedimentary sections exhibiting a similar facies succession, combining geological characterizations and multi-scale acoustic measurements. Based on outcrop investigation and petrographic description, we define nine sedimentary facies displaying contrasted early diagenetic evolutions. According to the vertical facies variations, we develop a depositional model corresponding to a low gradient valley fed by freshwaters, subdivided into three main domains (alluvial plain, palustrine and paludal). To understand the acoustic properties of the studied sedimentary rocks while remaining representative of their multi-scale heterogeneity, we acquire acoustic measurements at two different scales: i) at log-scale, directly on the outcrop surfaces using a frequency of 250 kHz; and ii) at plug-scale as usually done in laboratory using a frequency of 500 kHz. Based on these multi-scale geophysical acquisitions, we link in-situ P-wave velocities with the different sedimentary facies while characterizing centimeter-scale Representative Elementary Volumes (REVs). Conversely, based on laboratory measurements and thin-section petrography, we define relationships between P-wave velocity, porosity, facies, and diagenesis, corresponding to millimeter-scale REVs. Using both in-situ P-wave velocity measurements and plug densities, we construct 1-D synthetic seismograms showing meter-scale seismic reflectors equivalent to crosswell seismic frequency ranges. This approach shows the following: i) high-amplitude seismic reflectors fit with facies changes associated to diagenetic contrasts (e.g. cemented versus uncemented carbonates); ii) reflection free-zones match with a succession of facies changes affected by diagenetic homogenization (e.g. intensely to pervasively recrystallized and cemented carbonates). Our work highlights the importance of relating an extensive geological description of carbonates (facies, depositional model, diagenesis) together with multi-scale acoustic measurements and synthetic seismic modelling to predict the high-resolution heterogeneities of subsurface reservoirs.}

abstract = {The continuous redistribution of water involved in the hydrologic cycle leads to deformation of the solid Earth. On a global scale, this deformation is well explained by the loading imposed by hydrological mass variations and can be quantified to first order with space-based gravimetric and geodetic measurements. At the regional scale, however, aquifer systems also undergo poroelastic deformation in response to groundwater fluctuations. Disentangling these related but distinct 3D deformation fields from geodetic time series is essential to accurately invert for changes in continental water mass, to understand the mechanical response of aquifers to internal pressure changes as well as to correct time series for these known effects. Here, we demonstrate a methodology to accomplish this task by considering the example of the well-instrumented Ozark Plateaus Aquifer System (OPAS) in the central United States. We begin by characterizing the most important sources of groundwater level variations in the spatially heterogeneous piezometer dataset using an Independent Component Analysis. Then, to estimate the associated poroelastic displacements, we project geodetic time series corrected for hydrological loading effects onto the dominant groundwater temporal functions. We interpret the extracted displacements in light of analytical solutions and a 2D model relating groundwater level variations to surface displacements. In particular, the relatively low estimates of elastic moduli inferred from the poroelastic displacements and groundwater fluctuations may be indicative of aquifer layers with a high fracture density. Our findings suggest that OPAS undergoes significant poroelastic deformation, including highly heterogeneous horizontal poroelastic displacements.},

abstract = {Quantitatively assessing attenuation and dispersion of elastic-wave velocities in partially saturated reservoir is difficult because of its sensitivity to fluid distribution. We conducted experiments on homogeneous Indiana limestone samples, partially saturated by two methods: drying and imbibition which lead to different fluid distribution for a given saturation. Forced oscillations (from 0.004 to 100 Hz) and ultrasonic (1 MHz) measurements were done under confining pressure to measure the change of elastic moduli with frequency and their attenuation. Our measurements show that compressional (P-)velocities are strongly sensitive to the sample’s saturation method. For high saturations (above 80\%), obtained by drainage, compressional velocities are frequency dependent, and clear peaks of attenuation can be observed. However, at the same saturations obtained by imbibition, no dispersion or attenuation is observed. In addition, shear velocities show little variation with frequency, saturations, and fluid distribution. The dispersion and attenuation of P-velocities are shown to be influenced by the pore fluid distribution, which was investigated using micro-computer-assisted tomographic (CT) scans. Furthermore, a numerical model developed within the framework of poroelasticity’s theory predicts well the experimental results, using the fluid distribution obtained from CT as an input. Our results show that the velocity dispersion was related to wave-induced fluid flow at mesoscopic scale controlled by the geometry and distribution of the gas patches.},

abstract = {Seismic waves are typically assumed to propagate fast enough through a porous rock saturated with multiple fluid phases such that the interaction between the fluids can be considered adiabatic, or thermodynamically unrelaxed. However, at low gas saturations and when the gas is present in the form of microscopic bubbles the fluid mixture may in fact be thermodynamically relaxed at seismic frequencies. The effective fluid is then significantly more compressible. A transition from a thermodynamically relaxed to unrelaxed state of the fluids will be accompanied by frequency dependent attenuation of the wave in response to heat and/or mass transfer. We conducted experiments on two partially saturated sandstone samples to measure frequency dependent attenuation and modulus dispersion at seismic frequencies (\\&lt;1000 Hz). For CO2 saturations of 0.1–0.2 per cent we observe significant attenuation and dispersion in the bulk and shear modulus, with an attenuation peak at ∼100 Hz.

     abstract = "{Seismic waves are typically assumed to propagate fast enough through a porous rock saturated with multiple fluid phases such that the interaction between the fluids can be considered adiabatic, or thermodynamically unrelaxed. However, at low gas saturations and when the gas is present in the form of microscopic bubbles the fluid mixture may in fact be thermodynamically relaxed at seismic frequencies. The effective fluid is then significantly more compressible. A transition from a thermodynamically relaxed to unrelaxed state of the fluids will be accompanied by frequency dependent attenuation of the wave in response to heat and/or mass transfer. We conducted experiments on two partially saturated sandstone samples to measure frequency dependent attenuation and modulus dispersion at seismic frequencies (\\&lt;1000 Hz). For CO2 saturations of 0.1–0.2 per cent we observe significant attenuation and dispersion in the bulk and shear modulus, with an attenuation peak at ∼100 Hz. The bulk modulus was significantly lower than the prediction by Gassmann–Wood fluid substitution, which assumes that the fluids are thermodynamically unrelaxed.

abstract = {Abstract Among the impacts of earthquakes on aquifers, permeability change is one of the most challenging to quantify, since techniques to measure permeability evolution are scarce. The study of tidal response of boreholes is one of the most promising, yet complex to use in practice. We used 14 years of piezometric level measurements and two concurrent source signals, earth tidal strain and barometric pressure, for which we separated the respective contribution in a state-of-the-art tidal analysis. We developed a new general analytical hydrogeological model, based on geological observations of a confined bi-layer aquifer. It is able to match combined observations of earth and barometric tide phase lags which could not be explained by existing models. We demonstrate that its relative complexity can be overcome thanks to the results of tidal analysis, yielding a simpler model adapted to the Fond Lahaye site of the Martinique Island. The resulting evolution of diffusivity and loading efficiency, was validated independently with several pumping tests occurring all along the studied period. The transient diffusivity increases and decreases indicate which earthquakes impacted the aquifer, enabling to establish an empirical magnitude-distance relationship criterion. This criterion confirms the suspected dependence on dynamic stresses, which decrease as the square of the hypocentral distance. Additionally, we investigate two other factors of diffusivity changes: heavy rainfall events and aquifer withdrawals, which demonstrates the sensitivity of volcanic aquifers properties to environmental and anthropogenic influence.},

abstract = {Abstract On the Island of Samos (East Aegean region, Greece), two sedimentary basins are filled by thick continental series dated to the Late Miocene to Early Pliocene. A multidisciplinary study has been performed including (1) the definition of 21 sedimentary facies, (2) a review of the biological components and (3) carbon, oxygen and strontium stable isotope analyses. The succession is characterised by various depositional settings and hydrochemical compositions. Five main stages of basin evolution have been identified: (1) The Late Serravallian is marked by the development of alluvial fans and fan delta; (2) during the Lower Tortonian, isolated shallow lakes with variable salinity, from fresh to brackish, developed under warm and relatively humid conditions; (3) the Middle to Upper Tortonian is marked by the development of a large and deep lake with saline and alkaline waters, under colder and drier conditions; (4) the Latest Tortonian to Messinian period is represented by an ephemeral alluvial system, developed under a dry climate; (5) during the Zanclean, a palustrine and paludal wetland system, dominated by tufa carbonates, developed under moderately humid conditions. This succession is of particular interest for the reconstruction of the palaeoenvironmental evolution of the transition zone between the Mediterranean domain, and the Paratethys and circum-Paratethys areas. The geochemical data and the presence of flora (diatoms) and fauna (gastropods) of marine affinity suggest transient ingressions of marine-related water or groundwater inflows as early as the Lower Tortonian. The Samos succession records the complex interaction between the regional geodynamics and climate. The extensional regime of the Eastern Aegean zone generates subsidence, interrupted in the mid-Tortonian (9 Ma) by a brief compressive event and a major exposure of the basins. Furthermore, the Late Miocene progressive aridification, followed by a change to a more humid climate (Pliocene) is also a major driver of the sedimentation.},

abstract={Elastic wave attenuation in partially saturated porous rock is primarily due to wave-induced fluid flow, which arises from the contrast in compressibility between air and water and is influenced by the water distribution within the rock. We propose a method for constructing a numerical model that predicts mesoscopic dispersion and attenuation. Initially, we use fluid distribution data sourced from 3D X-ray Computed Tomography images to construct the numerical model, utilizing Biot’s poroelastic equations as the governing equations. Subsequently, we implement the finite element method to derive solutions for the numerical model. Our focus is centered on two key challenges: 1) reducing memory cost, and 2) efficiently handling element intersection during the meshing process. The solutions illustrate the evolution of fluid pressure distribution and the frequency-dependent advancement of the elastic moduli, coupled with their corresponding attenuation. Ultimately, we compare these numerical predictions with previously published experimental data from a study on partially saturated Indiana limestone. The considerable agreement between our numerical results and the experimental data confirms the validity of our method, which crucially incorporates the actual fluid distribution (captured from 3D CT images) as a vital input.},

     abstract = {The forced oscillation method is widely used to investigate intrinsic seismic wave dispersion and attenuation in rock samples by measuring their dynamic stress–strain response. However, using strain gauges to locally measure the strains on samples surfaces can result in errors in determining the attenuation and moduli of rocks with mesoscopic scale heterogeneities. In this study, we developed a 3-D numerical model based on Biot's poroelastic theory to investigate the effect of strain gauge location, number and size on attenuation and dispersion in response to wave-induced fluid flow. Our results show that increasing the strain gauge length, number, and size can reduce the error between local and bulk responses. In a homogeneous and isotropic rock with a quasi-fractal fluid heterogeneity at 12 per cent gas saturation, the relative error between local and bulk responses stays below 6 per cent when the strain gauge length surpasses 8.6 times the correlation length. As the gas saturation becomes larger, the ratio minimally changes non-monotonically, initially increasing and then decreasing. We also used the Monte Carlo method to demonstrate that local laboratory measurements can approximate the reservoir-scale response with a minimum relative error of 1.5 per cent as the sample number increases. Our findings provide guidance for (i) interpreting local low-frequency measurements in terms of bulk properties of rock and (ii) upscaling lab measurements to reservoir-scale properties.},

abstract = {Numerous experimental studies show significant differences between the static and dynamic elastic moduli of rocks. These differences are commonly attributed to the presence of cracks and uncemented grain contacts that make rocks non-linear elastic materials with a sensitivity to strain amplitude. To investigate the impact of strain amplitude on the bulk modulus of different rock types, we performed hydrostatic oscillations to induce strain amplitudes from 10–6 to 10–4 on the samples at frequencies ≤ 0.04 Hz. In addition, we measured the dynamic bulk modulus from ultrasonic wave velocities and the static bulk modulus from hydrostatic pressure ramps. In five out of the six samples, we observe a transition from the dynamic to static modulus with increasing strain amplitude. With increasing effective pressure, the bulk moduli increase, and the strain amplitude dependence is reduced. In the oolitic Chauvingy limestone, in contrast, we observed neither a significant strain nor effective pressure dependence on the bulk modulus, which is interpreted as the absence of pre-existing cracks. In the reservoir carbonate samples, for strain amplitudes > 5 × 10–5 the stress–strain loops become non-linear hysteretic and the measured attenuation plateaus. The presence of additional harmonics in the strain and the absence of harmonics in the stress, indicate that the non-linearity is inherent to the samples. The transition from dynamic to static bulk modulus is explained at first order by slip at grain contacts.},
