     abstract = {The forced oscillation method is widely used to investigate intrinsic seismic wave dispersion and attenuation in rock samples by measuring their dynamic stress–strain response. However, using strain gauges to locally measure the strains on samples surfaces can result in errors in determining the attenuation and moduli of rocks with mesoscopic scale heterogeneities. In this study, we developed a 3-D numerical model based on Biot's poroelastic theory to investigate the effect of strain gauge location, number and size on attenuation and dispersion in response to wave-induced fluid flow. Our results show that increasing the strain gauge length, number, and size can reduce the error between local and bulk responses. In a homogeneous and isotropic rock with a quasi-fractal fluid heterogeneity at 12 per cent gas saturation, the relative error between local and bulk responses stays below 6 per cent when the strain gauge length surpasses 8.6 times the correlation length. As the gas saturation becomes larger, the ratio minimally changes non-monotonically, initially increasing and then decreasing. We also used the Monte Carlo method to demonstrate that local laboratory measurements can approximate the reservoir-scale response with a minimum relative error of 1.5 per cent as the sample number increases. Our findings provide guidance for (i) interpreting local low-frequency measurements in terms of bulk properties of rock and (ii) upscaling lab measurements to reservoir-scale properties.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
