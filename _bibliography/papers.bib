   abstract = "Low‐frequency forced‐oscillation methods applied to a reservoir sandstone allowed determination of the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio (from axial loading), bulk modulus (by oscillation of the confining pressure) and shear modulus (from torsional‐forced oscillations) for comparison with conventional ultrasonic data. All tests were performed on a common sandstone core sample from an oil reservoir offshore West Africa. The results show a steady increase in ultrasonic velocities and shear modulus of the dry specimen as functions of pressure, which suggests a progressive closure of the inter‐granular contacts. An increase of bulk and Young's moduli and Poisson's ratio is observed on decane saturation of the sample when tested with a sufficiently small dead volume. This observation, consistent with Gassmann's theory, suggests that such measurements probe undrained (saturated isobaric) conditions. Diminution or absence of such fluid‐related stiffening for low‐frequency measurements with dead volumes comparable with the pore volume of the specimen indicates partially drained conditions and highlights the critical role of experimental boundary conditions. Directly measured bulk and shear moduli are consistent with those derived from Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio. These results of the inter‐laboratory testing using different measurement devices are consistent in terms of the effect of frequency and fluid saturation for the reservoir sandstone specimen. Such broad consistency illustrates the validity of forced‐oscillation techniques and constitutes an important benchmarking of laboratory testing of the elastic properties of a porous medium.",

abstract = {Quantitatively assessing seismic attenuation caused by fluid pressure diffusion (FPD) in partially saturated rocks is challenging because of its sensitivity to the spatial fluid distribution. To address this challenge we performed depressurization experiments to induce the exsolution of carbon dioxide from water in a Berea sandstone sample. In a first set of experiments we used medical X-ray computed tomography (CT) to characterize the fluid distribution. At an equilibrium pressure of approximately 1 MPa and applying a fluid pressure decline rate of approximately 0.6 MPa per minute, we allowed a change in saturation of less than 1\%. The gas was heterogeneously distributed along the length of the sample, with most of the gas exsolving near the sample outlet. In a second set of experiments, at the same pressure and temperature, following a very similar exsolution protocol, we measured the frequency dependent attenuation and modulus dispersion between 0.1 and 1,000 Hz using the forced oscillation method. We observed significant attenuation and dispersion in the extensional and bulk deformation modes, however, not in the shear mode. Lastly, we use the fluid distribution derived from the X-ray CT as an input for numerical simulations of FPD to compute the attenuation and modulus dispersion. The numerical solutions are in close agreement with the attenuation and modulus dispersion measured in the laboratory. Our approach allows for accurately relating attenuation and dispersion to the fluid distribution, which can be applied to improving the seismic monitoring of the subsurface.},

abstract = {Abstract To test theoretical models of modulus dispersion and dissipation in fluid-saturated rocks, we have investigated the broadband mechanical properties of four thermally cracked glass specimens of simple microstructure with complementary forced-oscillation (0.004–100 Hz) and ultrasonic techniques (~1 MHz). Strong pressure dependence of moduli (bulk, Young's, and shear), axial strain, and ultrasonic wave speeds for dry conditions attests to essentially complete crack closure at a confining pressure of 15 MPa—consistent with ambient-pressure crack aspect ratios ≤2 × 10−4. Oscillation of the confining pressure reveals bulk modulus dispersion and a corresponding dissipation peak, near 0.002 Hz only at the lowest effective pressure (2.5 MPa)—attributed to the transition with increasing frequency from the drained to saturated-isobaric regime. The observations are consistent with Biot-Gassmann's theory, with dispersion and dissipation adequately represented by Zener model. Above the draining frequency, axial forced-oscillation tests show dispersion of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio, and an associated broad dissipation peak centered near 0.3 Hz, thought to reflect local “squirt” flow and adequately modeled with a continuous distribution of relaxation times over two decades. Observations of Young's and shear moduli dispersion and dissipation from complementary flexural and torsional oscillation measurements for differential pressure ≤10 MPa provide supporting evidence of the transition with increasing frequency from the saturated-isobaric to the saturated-isolated regime—also probed by ultrasonic technique. These findings validate predictions from theoretical models of dispersion in cracked media and emphasize need for caution in the seismological application of laboratory ultrasonic data for cracked media.},

abstract = {Pore pressure has a major influence on the effective stress and thus on the mechanical behaviour of rocks. In this study, we focus on the hydro-mechanical behaviour of a low porosity andesitic rock heat-treated to 930 °C to induce thermal cracks and increase the permeability of the samples. First, we show that permeability decreases from 8 × 10−16 m2 to 1.5 × 10−17 m2 with a confining pressure (Pc) increase from 2 MPa to 40 MPa (pore pressure being approximately 0.2 MPa). Then, we used fibre optic pressure sensors to monitor pore pressure diffusion at three points along the sample during the propagation of a pore pressure pulse under hydrostatic (Pc=40 MPa) and triaxial stresses (Pc=40 MPa, differential stress of 356 MPa). When the pore pressure pulse was applied, the fibre optic sensors showed a sudden pore pressure increase one after the other as a function of their location along the sample. Pore pressure increase downstream was very smooth under hydrostatic stress and almost zero after the duration of the experiment (50 min) under triaxial stresses. This lack of downstream pore pressure increase under triaxial stresses is due to the fact that a differential stress of 356 MPa decreased permeability from approximately 10−17m2 to approximately 10−19m2. Finally, the pore pressure diffusion process was modelled considering a uniform spatial distribution of permeability in the andesite sample and the dead volume attached at the downstream side.}

abstract={A saturated Bleurswiller sandstone, of 25% porosity, was compacted by increasing the confining pressure over the critical pressure P* which characterizes the onset of pore collapse and grain crushing. The frequency-dependence of Young’s moduli were measured before and after the compaction using forced-oscillation method in a triaxial cell. For the intact and compacted samples, we observed one dispersive transition within the seismic band (0.01–100 Hz). The dispersion is consistent with crack-to-pore squirt flow, making the transition from the relaxed to the unrelaxed fluid-flow regime. The induced compaction shifted the critical frequency of the squirt-flow dispersion towards higher frequencies, thus moving it out of the seismic band and allowing Biot-Gassmann to fully apply. This result is a consequence of an increase in the crack aspect ratio after compaction. In addition, the dispersion of elastic modulus after compaction increases from about 25 to 30%, related to the increase of crack fraction.},

    abstract = "{Studies on the mechanical behaviour of rocks, including volcanic rocks, usually seek for unaltered and simple material: rocks without macroscopic defects. However, volcanic rocks are often naturally altered due to the circulation of hydrothermal fluids. This alteration may influence mechanical and physical properties. Here, we study the effect of hydrothermal alteration on the elasticity and failure properties of andesite. A homogeneous block of natural andesite was retrieved from a quarry. Three samples were first heat-treated and then artificially altered at different temperatures by soaking them in a brine for one month at a pressure of 20 MPa and temperatures of 80, 180 and 280 °C. Heat-treated unaltered and altered samples were hydrostatically loaded up to 50 MPa and unloaded, while strains and elastic wave velocities were recorded. Samples were also triaxially deformed to failure at a constant strain rate and a confining pressure of 15 MPa. At ambient pressure, increased alteration temperature resulted in increased wave propagation velocity, thus increased dynamic elastic moduli. During hydrostatic loading, volumetric deformation at a given effective pressure decreased with alteration temperature denoting increased static elastic moduli. During triaxial loading, the degree of alteration decreased elastic compaction and peak stress at failure. These observations are interpreted as the result of microcracks in-filling by alteration minerals, and in particular smectite, a swelling-clay mineral with a low friction coefficient. The mechanical behaviour of a volcanic rock subjected to triaxial loading was modelled with a damage model based on crack propagation from pre-existing flaws. A decreasing friction coefficient within the flanks of the cracks leads to a decrease of the peak stress and explains the experimental observations.}",

Second, we reproduce at the scale of the laboratory the complete spectrum of rupture velocities observed in nature. Our results show that the rupture velocity can range from a few millimetres to kilometres per second, depending on the available energy at the onset of slip, in agreement with theoretical predictions.

abstract = {Abstract The variation of the seismic properties with frequency of a brine-saturated sandstone sample with a porosity of 22\% was measured using a forced oscillation apparatus. Two pairs of orthogonal biaxial strain gauges were pasted at different locations at the length center of the sample. In the frequency range of 1–300 Hz, using these two pairs of strain gauges, we observed experimentally the same global flow but different local flows (squirt flow). Therefore, the observation of the local flow is influenced by the position of the strain gauges in contrast to the global flow. Indeed, local flow is strongly influenced by the microstructure (structure of the grain contacts and microcracks). In particular, we show that although the sample is homogeneous in terms of porosity and crack density, it is not the case in terms of crack aspect ratio, which may slightly vary along the sample. A 3D diffusion model coupled with a simple squirt model was built to further interpret the data. These results show that the wave-induced fluid flows occur at different scales and controls the dispersion and attenuation of saturated rocks.},

Using thirteen years of groundwater level observations, we highlight clear permeability variations induced by earthquakes in an aquifer and overlaying aquitard. Dynamic stresses, above a threshold value PGV > 0.5 cm s−1, were mostly responsible for these variations. We develop a new model using earth tides responses of water levels between earthquakes. We demonstrate a clear permeability increase of the hydrogeological system, with the permeability of the aquifer increasing 20-fold and that of the aquitard 300-fold over 12 years, induced by fracture creation or fracture unclogging. In addition, we demonstrate unprecedented observations of increase in permeability due to the effect of extreme tropical deluges of rainfall and hurricanes. The water pressure increase induced by the exceptional rainfall events thus act as piston strokes strong enough to unclog congested fractures by colloids, particles or precipitates. Lastly, an analysis of regional permeabilities also highlights a permeability increase over geological timeframes (× 40 per million years), corroborating the trend observed over the last decade. This demonstrates that permeability of aquifers of andesitic volcanic islands, such as the Lesser Antilles, significantly evolve with time due to seismic activity and extreme rainfall.},

abstract = {Continental carbonates are characterized by multi-scale heterogeneous porous networks, making the geological interpretation of seismic imaging difficult. We investigate two sedimentary sections exhibiting a similar facies succession, combining geological characterizations and multi-scale acoustic measurements. Based on outcrop investigation and petrographic description, we define nine sedimentary facies displaying contrasted early diagenetic evolutions. According to the vertical facies variations, we develop a depositional model corresponding to a low gradient valley fed by freshwaters, subdivided into three main domains (alluvial plain, palustrine and paludal). To understand the acoustic properties of the studied sedimentary rocks while remaining representative of their multi-scale heterogeneity, we acquire acoustic measurements at two different scales: i) at log-scale, directly on the outcrop surfaces using a frequency of 250 kHz; and ii) at plug-scale as usually done in laboratory using a frequency of 500 kHz. Based on these multi-scale geophysical acquisitions, we link in-situ P-wave velocities with the different sedimentary facies while characterizing centimeter-scale Representative Elementary Volumes (REVs). Conversely, based on laboratory measurements and thin-section petrography, we define relationships between P-wave velocity, porosity, facies, and diagenesis, corresponding to millimeter-scale REVs. Using both in-situ P-wave velocity measurements and plug densities, we construct 1-D synthetic seismograms showing meter-scale seismic reflectors equivalent to crosswell seismic frequency ranges. This approach shows the following: i) high-amplitude seismic reflectors fit with facies changes associated to diagenetic contrasts (e.g. cemented versus uncemented carbonates); ii) reflection free-zones match with a succession of facies changes affected by diagenetic homogenization (e.g. intensely to pervasively recrystallized and cemented carbonates). Our work highlights the importance of relating an extensive geological description of carbonates (facies, depositional model, diagenesis) together with multi-scale acoustic measurements and synthetic seismic modelling to predict the high-resolution heterogeneities of subsurface reservoirs.}

abstract = {The continuous redistribution of water involved in the hydrologic cycle leads to deformation of the solid Earth. On a global scale, this deformation is well explained by the loading imposed by hydrological mass variations and can be quantified to first order with space-based gravimetric and geodetic measurements. At the regional scale, however, aquifer systems also undergo poroelastic deformation in response to groundwater fluctuations. Disentangling these related but distinct 3D deformation fields from geodetic time series is essential to accurately invert for changes in continental water mass, to understand the mechanical response of aquifers to internal pressure changes as well as to correct time series for these known effects. Here, we demonstrate a methodology to accomplish this task by considering the example of the well-instrumented Ozark Plateaus Aquifer System (OPAS) in the central United States. We begin by characterizing the most important sources of groundwater level variations in the spatially heterogeneous piezometer dataset using an Independent Component Analysis. Then, to estimate the associated poroelastic displacements, we project geodetic time series corrected for hydrological loading effects onto the dominant groundwater temporal functions. We interpret the extracted displacements in light of analytical solutions and a 2D model relating groundwater level variations to surface displacements. In particular, the relatively low estimates of elastic moduli inferred from the poroelastic displacements and groundwater fluctuations may be indicative of aquifer layers with a high fracture density. Our findings suggest that OPAS undergoes significant poroelastic deformation, including highly heterogeneous horizontal poroelastic displacements.},

abstract = {Quantitatively assessing attenuation and dispersion of elastic-wave velocities in partially saturated reservoir is difficult because of its sensitivity to fluid distribution. We conducted experiments on homogeneous Indiana limestone samples, partially saturated by two methods: drying and imbibition which lead to different fluid distribution for a given saturation. Forced oscillations (from 0.004 to 100 Hz) and ultrasonic (1 MHz) measurements were done under confining pressure to measure the change of elastic moduli with frequency and their attenuation. Our measurements show that compressional (P-)velocities are strongly sensitive to the sample’s saturation method. For high saturations (above 80\%), obtained by drainage, compressional velocities are frequency dependent, and clear peaks of attenuation can be observed. However, at the same saturations obtained by imbibition, no dispersion or attenuation is observed. In addition, shear velocities show little variation with frequency, saturations, and fluid distribution. The dispersion and attenuation of P-velocities are shown to be influenced by the pore fluid distribution, which was investigated using micro-computer-assisted tomographic (CT) scans. Furthermore, a numerical model developed within the framework of poroelasticity’s theory predicts well the experimental results, using the fluid distribution obtained from CT as an input. Our results show that the velocity dispersion was related to wave-induced fluid flow at mesoscopic scale controlled by the geometry and distribution of the gas patches.},

abstract = {Seismic waves are typically assumed to propagate fast enough through a porous rock saturated with multiple fluid phases such that the interaction between the fluids can be considered adiabatic, or thermodynamically unrelaxed. However, at low gas saturations and when the gas is present in the form of microscopic bubbles the fluid mixture may in fact be thermodynamically relaxed at seismic frequencies. The effective fluid is then significantly more compressible. A transition from a thermodynamically relaxed to unrelaxed state of the fluids will be accompanied by frequency dependent attenuation of the wave in response to heat and/or mass transfer. We conducted experiments on two partially saturated sandstone samples to measure frequency dependent attenuation and modulus dispersion at seismic frequencies (\\&lt;1000 Hz). For CO2 saturations of 0.1–0.2 per cent we observe significant attenuation and dispersion in the bulk and shear modulus, with an attenuation peak at ∼100 Hz. The bulk modulus was significantly lower than the prediction by Gassmann–Wood fluid substitution, which assumes that the fluids are thermodynamically unrelaxed.

     abstract = "{Seismic waves are typically assumed to propagate fast enough through a porous rock saturated with multiple fluid phases such that the interaction between the fluids can be considered adiabatic, or thermodynamically unrelaxed. However, at low gas saturations and when the gas is present in the form of microscopic bubbles the fluid mixture may in fact be thermodynamically relaxed at seismic frequencies. The effective fluid is then significantly more compressible. A transition from a thermodynamically relaxed to unrelaxed state of the fluids will be accompanied by frequency dependent attenuation of the wave in response to heat and/or mass transfer. We conducted experiments on two partially saturated sandstone samples to measure frequency dependent attenuation and modulus dispersion at seismic frequencies (\\&lt;1000 Hz). For CO2 saturations of 0.1–0.2 per cent we observe significant attenuation and dispersion in the bulk and shear modulus, with an attenuation peak at ∼100 Hz. The bulk modulus was significantly lower than the prediction by Gassmann–Wood fluid substitution, which assumes that the fluids are thermodynamically unrelaxed. Numerical simulations in poroelastic media further indicate that a partially drained boundary condition does not adequately explain the observed attenuation and dispersion, particularly in the shear modulus.

abstract = {Abstract Among the impacts of earthquakes on aquifers, permeability change is one of the most challenging to quantify, since techniques to measure permeability evolution are scarce. The study of tidal response of boreholes is one of the most promising, yet complex to use in practice. We used 14 years of piezometric level measurements and two concurrent source signals, earth tidal strain and barometric pressure, for which we separated the respective contribution in a state-of-the-art tidal analysis. We developed a new general analytical hydrogeological model, based on geological observations of a confined bi-layer aquifer. It is able to match combined observations of earth and barometric tide phase lags which could not be explained by existing models. We demonstrate that its relative complexity can be overcome thanks to the results of tidal analysis, yielding a simpler model adapted to the Fond Lahaye site of the Martinique Island. The resulting evolution of diffusivity and loading efficiency, was validated independently with several pumping tests occurring all along the studied period. The transient diffusivity increases and decreases indicate which earthquakes impacted the aquifer, enabling to establish an empirical magnitude-distance relationship criterion. This criterion confirms the suspected dependence on dynamic stresses, which decrease as the square of the hypocentral distance. Additionally, we investigate two other factors of diffusivity changes: heavy rainfall events and aquifer withdrawals, which demonstrates the sensitivity of volcanic aquifers properties to environmental and anthropogenic influence.},

abstract = {Abstract On the Island of Samos (East Aegean region, Greece), two sedimentary basins are filled by thick continental series dated to the Late Miocene to Early Pliocene. A multidisciplinary study has been performed including (1) the definition of 21 sedimentary facies, (2) a review of the biological components and (3) carbon, oxygen and strontium stable isotope analyses. The succession is characterised by various depositional settings and hydrochemical compositions. Five main stages of basin evolution have been identified: (1) The Late Serravallian is marked by the development of alluvial fans and fan delta; (2) during the Lower Tortonian, isolated shallow lakes with variable salinity, from fresh to brackish, developed under warm and relatively humid conditions; (3) the Middle to Upper Tortonian is marked by the development of a large and deep lake with saline and alkaline waters, under colder and drier conditions; (4) the Latest Tortonian to Messinian period is represented by an ephemeral alluvial system, developed under a dry climate; (5) during the Zanclean, a palustrine and paludal wetland system, dominated by tufa carbonates, developed under moderately humid conditions. This succession is of particular interest for the reconstruction of the palaeoenvironmental evolution of the transition zone between the Mediterranean domain, and the Paratethys and circum-Paratethys areas. The geochemical data and the presence of flora (diatoms) and fauna (gastropods) of marine affinity suggest transient ingressions of marine-related water or groundwater inflows as early as the Lower Tortonian. The Samos succession records the complex interaction between the regional geodynamics and climate. The extensional regime of the Eastern Aegean zone generates subsidence, interrupted in the mid-Tortonian (9 Ma) by a brief compressive event and a major exposure of the basins. Furthermore, the Late Miocene progressive aridification, followed by a change to a more humid climate (Pliocene) is also a major driver of the sedimentation.},

abstract={Elastic wave attenuation in partially saturated porous rock is primarily due to wave-induced fluid flow, which arises from the contrast in compressibility between air and water and is influenced by the water distribution within the rock. We propose a method for constructing a numerical model that predicts mesoscopic dispersion and attenuation. Initially, we use fluid distribution data sourced from 3D X-ray Computed Tomography images to construct the numerical model, utilizing Biot’s poroelastic equations as the governing equations. Subsequently, we implement the finite element method to derive solutions for the numerical model. Our focus is centered on two key challenges: 1) reducing memory cost, and 2) efficiently handling element intersection during the meshing process. The solutions illustrate the evolution of fluid pressure distribution and the frequency-dependent advancement of the elastic moduli, coupled with their corresponding attenuation. Ultimately, we compare these numerical predictions with previously published experimental data from a study on partially saturated Indiana limestone. The considerable agreement between our numerical results and the experimental data confirms the validity of our method, which crucially incorporates the actual fluid distribution (captured from 3D CT images) as a vital input.},

However, using strain gauges to locally measure the strains on samples surfaces can result in errors in determining the attenuation and moduli of rocks with mesoscopic scale heterogeneities. In this study, we developed a 3-D numerical model based on Biot's poroelastic theory to investigate the effect of strain gauge location, number and size on attenuation and dispersion in response to wave-induced fluid flow. Our results show that increasing the strain gauge length, number, and size can reduce the error between local and bulk responses. In a homogeneous and isotropic rock with a quasi-fractal fluid heterogeneity at 12 per cent gas saturation, the relative error between local and bulk responses stays below 6 per cent when the strain gauge length surpasses 8.6 times the correlation length. As the gas saturation becomes larger, the ratio minimally changes non-monotonically, initially increasing and then decreasing. We also used the Monte Carlo method to demonstrate that local laboratory measurements can approximate the reservoir-scale response with a minimum relative error of 1.5 per cent as the sample number increases. Our findings provide guidance for (i) interpreting local low-frequency measurements in terms of bulk properties of rock and (ii) upscaling lab measurements to reservoir-scale properties.},

abstract = {Numerous experimental studies show significant differences between the static and dynamic elastic moduli of rocks. These differences are commonly attributed to the presence of cracks and uncemented grain contacts that make rocks non-linear elastic materials with a sensitivity to strain amplitude. To investigate the impact of strain amplitude on the bulk modulus of different rock types, we performed hydrostatic oscillations to induce strain amplitudes from 10–6 to 10–4 on the samples at frequencies ≤ 0.04 Hz. In addition, we measured the dynamic bulk modulus from ultrasonic wave velocities and the static bulk modulus from hydrostatic pressure ramps. In five out of the six samples, we observe a transition from the dynamic to static modulus with increasing strain amplitude. With increasing effective pressure, the bulk moduli increase, and the strain amplitude dependence is reduced. In the oolitic Chauvingy limestone, in contrast, we observed neither a significant strain nor effective pressure dependence on the bulk modulus, which is interpreted as the absence of pre-existing cracks. In the reservoir carbonate samples, for strain amplitudes > 5 × 10–5 the stress–strain loops become non-linear hysteretic and the measured attenuation plateaus. The presence of additional harmonics in the strain and the absence of harmonics in the stress, indicate that the non-linearity is inherent to the samples. The transition from dynamic to static bulk modulus is explained at first order by slip at grain contacts.},

abstract = {Abstract The frequency dependence of seismic properties of fully saturated rocks can be related to wave-induced fluid flows at different scales. The elastic dispersion and attenuation of four fluid-saturated carbonate rocks, with different microstructures, have been measured over a broad frequency range in the laboratory. The selected rocks were a presalt coquina from offshore Congo, an Urgonian limestone from Provence (France), and an Indiana limestone either intact or thermally cracked. The selected samples present a variety of pore types characteristic of carbonates, and their link with potential squirt flow dispersion was investigated. To cover a broad frequency range, forced oscillations (0.004 to 100 Hz) and ultrasonic (1 MHz) measurement techniques were performed in a triaxial cell, at various differential pressures, on the samples saturated by fluids of different viscosity. Both hydrostatic and axial oscillations were applied in order to get the different dynamic moduli. For all our samples, the drained/undrained transition and the squirt flow mechanisms were characterized experimentally, in terms of amplitude of dispersion, amount of viscoelastic attenuation, and frequency ranges. Biot-Gassmann's theory was found to apply mainly at seismic frequencies (10–100 Hz). A potential correlation between pore type and possible squirt flow dispersion was investigated. Intragranular microporosity, with either a rimmed or uniform distribution, does not seem to generate any substantial dispersion. On the other hand, cracked intergranular cement and uncemented grain contacts seem to generate substantial squirt flow dispersion, at respectively seismic and sonic log frequencies.},

abstract = {Linking ultrasonic measurements made on samples, with sonic logs and seismic subsurface data, is a key challenge for the understanding of carbonate reservoirs. To deal with this problem, we investigate the elastic properties of dry lacustrine carbonates. At one study site, we perform a seismic refraction survey (100 Hz), as well as “sonic” (54 kHz) and ultrasonic (250 kHz) measurements directly on outcrop and ultrasonic measurements on samples (500 kHz). By comparing the median of each data set, we show that the P wave velocity decreases from laboratory to seismic scale. Nevertheless, the median of the sonic measurements acquired on outcrop surfaces seems to fit with the seismic data, meaning that sonic acquisition may be representative of seismic scale. To explain the variations due to upscaling, we relate the concept of representative elementary volume with the wavelength of each scale of study. Indeed, with upscaling, the wavelength varies from millimetric to pluri-metric. This change of scale allows us to conclude that the behavior of P wave velocity is due to different geological features (matrix porosity, cracks, and fractures) related to the different wavelengths used. Based on effective medium theory, we quantify the pore aspect ratio at sample scale and the crack/fracture density at outcrop and seismic scales using a multiscale representative elementary volume concept. Results show that the matrix porosity that controls the ultrasonic P wave velocities is progressively lost with upscaling, implying that crack and fracture porosity impacts sonic and seismic P wave velocities, a result of paramount importance for seismic interpretation based on deterministic approaches.},

abstract = {For the subsurface characterization of carbonates, linking physical properties (e.g. porosity and seismic reflectors) with their geological significance (e.g. sedimentary facies and diage-nesis) is of primary importance. To address this issue, we study the lacustrine and palustrine carbonates on Samos Island through a geological and geophysical characterization of a sed-imentary succession. The microstructures of the samples are described, and the samples' physical properties are measured (porosity, P-wave velocity and density). The results show that the identification of only the primary (i.e. sedimentary) microstructure is not sufficient for explaining the huge variations in porosity and P-wave velocity. Hence, we highlight two early diagenetic processes that strongly impact the microstructures and control the physical properties: (i) neomorphism occludes porosity and increases the P-wave velocity of mud-and grain-supported microstructures, which implies a mineralogical stabilization of the grains; (ii) conversely, the dissolution process creates porosity and decreases the P-wave velocity of grain-supported microstructures if the mineralogical composition of the grains is not previously stabilized. These two diagenetic processes thus depend on the primary microstructures and mineralogy of the sediments. This work aims to explain the variations in porosity and P-wave velocity for each defined primary microstructure. A 1-D seismogram is then built to highlight seismic reflectors with a metre-scale resolution. These reflectors are associated with several geological contrasts. Hard kicks (positive amplitude reflectors) match well with exposure surfaces related to palaeosols. They correspond to contrasts between non-modified primary microstructures and highly neomorphosed microstructures. Conversely, soft kicks (negative amplitude reflectors) are linked with diagenetic contrasts (e.g. neomorphosed mi-crostructures versus non-modified primary microstructures) and sedimentary contrasts that can be overprinted by diagenesis (e.g. neomorphosed mud-supported microstructures versus dissolved grain-supported microstructures). This study highlights that high-resolution seismic reflectors of lacustrine and palustrine carbonates are strongly related to the spatial contrasts of primary microstructures overprinted by early diagenesis.},

Under water-saturated condition, clear dispersion and attenuation for Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and Bulk modulus are observed at seismic frequencies, except for shear modulus. The measured dispersion and attenuation are mainly attributed to the drained/undrained transition, which considers the experimentally undrained boundary condition. Gassmann's predictions are consistent with the measured undrained bulk moduli but not with the shear moduli. Clear shear weakening is observed, and this water-softening effect is stronger at seismic frequencies than at ultrasonic frequencies where stiffening effect related to squirt flow may mask real shear weakening. The reduction in surface free energy due to chemical interaction between pore fluid and rock frame, which is not taken into account by Gassmann's theory, is the main reason for the departure from Gassmann's predictions, especially for this rock containing a large number of clay minerals.},

abstract = {Elastic wave velocities are key parameters in geosciences. In seismology at a large scale, or in seismic exploration at a more local and shallower scale, they were the main source of information for a long time. At the time of the Apollo mission, Anderson explained the unexpected result of very low velocities in Moon surface rocks by an intense cracking resulting from meteoritic impacts. Yet, it was also known that the Q factor was high. This could appear as a paradox. In the shallow layers of the Earth, rocks are porous. These shallow layers are of major importance in the Earth since they contain fluids. This is why velocities are higher and Q values lower in the Earth’s shallow layers than in the Moon’s shallow layers. Cracks have a determining effect on elastic properties because they are very compliant. Fluids also play a key role. Combining poroelasticity and effective elasticity, two independent theories much developed since the time of the Apollo mission, makes it possible to revisit the contrasting results observed in the Moon case and in the Earth case. Experimental results obtained on cracked synthetic glass show that dry cracks result in a strong decrease in velocity. On the other hand, saturated porous limestones exhibit a strong frequency-dependent attenuation when thermally cracked. The presence of fluid is the key factor.},

The effects of heat treatment temperatures ranging between 500 °C and 1100 °C on the P-wave velocities and on the microstructure were investigated. Then, the mechanical properties of andesite samples treated at 930 °C were investigated under triaxial stress at room temperature using constant strain rate tests and confining pressures ranging between 0 and 30 MPa. Similar triaxial experiments were conducted on non-heat-treated samples. Our results show that: (1) for heat treatments at temperatures below 500 °C, no significant changes in the physical properties are observed; (2) for heat treatments in the temperature range of 500–1100 °C, crack density increases; and (3) thermal cracking has no influence on the onset of dilatancy but increases the strength of the heat-treated samples. This last result is counterintuitive, but seems to be linked with the presence of a small fraction of clay (3%) in the non-heat-treated andesite. Indeed, for heat treatment above 500 °C, some clay melting is observed and contributes to sealing the longest cracks.},

To study squirt flow experimentally at seismic frequencies the forced oscillation method is the most adequate, but such studies are still scarce. Here we present the results of forced hydrostatic and axial oscillation experiments on dry and glycerine‐saturated Berea sandstone, from which we determine the dynamic stiffness moduli and attenuation at micro‐seismic and seismic frequencies (0.004–30 Hz). We observe frequency‐dependent attenuation and the associated moduli dispersion in response to the drained–undrained transition (∼0.1 Hz) and squirt flow (>3 Hz), which are in fairly good agreement with the results of the corresponding analytical solutions. The comparison with very similar experiments performed also on Berea sandstone in addition shows that squirt flow can potentially be a source of wave attenuation across a wide range of frequencies because of its sensitivity to small variations in the rock microstructure, especially in the aspect ratio of micro‐cracks or grain contacts.},

Because no laboratory data reported such high values in isotropic rocks, mineralogical or anisotropic constrains were assumed. However, fluid-saturated rocks' Vp/Vs is a frequency-dependent property so that standard laboratory measurements cannot be directly upscaled to the field. Using a new methodology, we measured the property in the elastic regime relevant to field measurements for diverse lithologies. We obtained extreme Vp/Vs values, consistent with those reported at seismic frequency in the field. Consistently with a model, it shows that if high fluid pressure is a key factor, anomalous Vp/Vs values could evidence intense degrees of microfracturation in isotropic rocks, whichever its mineralogical content.

Here a rock specimen of Westerly granite was submitted to differential stress cycles (i.e., loading and unloading) of increasing amplitudes, up to failure and under upper crustal conditions. Combined records of strains, acoustic emissions, and P and S elastic wave anisotropies demonstrate that increasing differential stress promotes crack opening, sliding, and propagation subparallel to the main compressive stress orientation. However, the significant elastic anisotropies observed during loading (≥20\%) almost vanish upon stress removal, demonstrating that in the absence of stress, crack-related elastic anisotropy remains limited (≤10\%). As a consequence, (i) crack-related elastic anisotropies measured in the crust will likely be a strong function of the level of differential stress, and consequently (ii) continuous monitoring of elastic wave velocity anisotropy along faults could shed light on the mechanism of stress accumulation during interseismic loading.},

      abstract = "{We have provided new insights into the controlling factors of elastic properties in continental carbonate rocks and introduced an applicable model for acoustic-velocity predictions in such a medium. Petrophysical properties (porosity, permeability, P- and S-wave velocities) from laboratory measurements have been coupled with thin-section observations and characterizations, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses. A major achievement is the establishment of the link between the mineralogical composition and the P- and S-wave velocity dispersion at a given porosity. This reflects the subtle interplay between physicochemical and biological precipitation of continental carbonates, which can also be associated with a strong influence of detrital mineralogical inputs. The result is a mineralogical commixture, coupled to a wide array of pore types inherited from the strong ability of carbonate rocks to undergo diagenetic alteration. The proposed model takes into account the elastic moduli of the minerals, porosity, and pore shape, and it is based on the effective medium theory. We have considered the case in which the medium contained randomly oriented pores with different aspect ratios. Overall, the fit between the predicted trends and the experimental data is fairly good, especially for calcite and quartz matrix mineralogy. The results are even better when considering mineralogy inferred from XRD data, although in some case, and despite the aspect ratio variation in both simulations, the model fails to accurately predict the P-wave velocities. This probably means that another factor is at stake beside mineralogy. This can be explained by the limitation of the effective medium approach, which oversimplifies the reality and fails to account for the variability of some aspect ratio from one inclusion to another.}",

    abstract = "{Measuring the permeability of tight rocks remains a challenging task. In addition to the traditional sources of errors that affect more permeable formations (e.g. sample selection, non-representative specimens, disturbance introduced during sample acquisition and preparation), tight rocks can be particularly prone to solid–fluid interactions and thus more sensitive to the methods, procedures and techniques used to measure permeability. To address this problem, it is desirable to collect, for a single material, measurements obtained by different methods and pore-fluids. For that purpose a collaborative benchmarking exercise involving 24 laboratories was organized for measuring the permeability of a single low permeability material, the Grimsel granodiorite, at a common effective confining pressure (5 MPa). The objectives of the benchmark were: (i) to compare the results for a given method, (ii) to compare the results between different methods, (iii) to analyze the accuracy of each method, (iv) to study the influence of experimental conditions (especially the nature of pore fluid), (v) to discuss the relevance of indirect methods and models and finally (vi) to suggest good practice for low permeability measurements. In total 39 measurements were collected that allowed us to discuss the influence of (i) pore-fluid, (ii) measurement method, (iii) sample size and (iv) pressure sensitivity. Discarding some outliers from the bulk data set (4 out of 39) an average permeability of 1.11 × 10−18 m² with a standard deviation of 0.57 × 10−18 m² was obtained. The most striking result was the large difference in permeability for gas measurements compared to liquid measurements. Regardless of the method used, gas permeability was higher than liquid permeability by a factor approximately 2 (kgas = 1.28 × 10−18 m² compared to kliquid = 0.65 × 10−18 m²). Possible explanations are that (i) liquid permeability was underestimated due to fluid-rock interactions (ii) gas permeability was overestimated due to insufficient correction for gas slippage and/or (iii) gases and liquids do not probe exactly the same porous networks. The analysis of Knudsen numbers shows that the gas permeability measurements were performed in conditions for which the Klinkenberg correction is sufficient. Smaller samples had a larger scatter of permeability values, suggesting that their volume were below the Representative Elementary Volume. The pressure dependence of permeability was studied by some of the participating teams in the range 1–30 MPa and could be fitted to an exponential law k = ko.exp(–γPeff) with γ = 0.093 MPa−1. Good practice rules for measuring permeability in tight materials are also provided.}",

Broad ion beam—scanning electron microscopy, micro-computerized tomography, mercury injection capillary pressure (MICP) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods were used to characterize the microstructures and provided the input parameters for permeability modelling. Several models were used: (i) basic statistical models, (ii) 3-D pore network and effective medium models, (iii) percolation model using MICP data and (iv) free-fluid model using NMR data. The models were generally successful in predicting the actual range of measured permeability. Statistical models overestimate the permeability because they do not adequately account for the heterogeneity of the crack network. Pore network and effective medium models provide additional constraints on crack parameters such as aspect ratio, aperture, density and connectivity. MICP and advanced microscopy techniques are very useful tools providing important input data for permeability estimation. Permeability measured—orthogonal to foliation is lower that—parallel to foliation. Combining the experimental and modelling results provide a unique and rich data set.}",

abstract = {Due to their complex structure and the difficulty of collecting data, the hydrogeology of basaltic islands remains misunderstood, and the Galapagos islands are not an exception. Geophysics allows the possibility to describe the subsurface of these islands and to quantify the hydrodynamical properties of its ground layers, which can be useful to build robust hydrogeological models. In this paper, we present seismic refraction data acquired on Santa Cruz and San Cristobal, the two main inhabited islands of Galapagos. We investigated sites with several hydrogeological contexts, located at different altitudes and at different distances to the coast. At each site, a 2D P-wave velocity profile is built, highlighting unsaturated and saturated volcanic layers. At the coastal sites, seawater intrusion is identified and basal aquifer is characterized in terms of variations in compressional sound wave velocities, according to saturation state. At highlands sites, the limits between soils and lava flows are identified. On San Cristobal Island, the 2D velocity profile obtained on a mid-slope site (altitude 150m), indicates the presence of a near surface freshwater aquifer, which is in agreement with previous geophysical studies and the hydrogeological conceptual model developed for this island. The originality of our paper is the use of velocity data to compute field porosity based on poroelasticity theory and the Biot-Gassmann equations. Given that porosity is a key parameter in quantitative hydrogeological models, it is a step forward to a better understanding of shallow fluid flows within a complex structure, such as Galapagos volcanoes.}

abstract = {Abstract Deformation and failure mode of carbonate rocks depend on the confining pressure. In this study, the mechanical behavior of a limestone with an initial porosity of 14.7\% is investigated at constant stress. At confining pressures below 55 MPa, dilatancy associated with microfracturing occurs during constant stress steps, ultimately leading to failure, similar to creep in other brittle media. At confining pressures higher than 55 MPa, depending on applied differential stress, inelastic compaction occurs, accommodated by crystal plasticity and characterized by constant ultrasonic wave velocities, or dilatancy resulting from nucleation and propagation of cracks due to local stress concentrations associated with dislocation pileups, ultimately causing failure. Strain rates during secondary creep preceding dilative brittle failure are sensitive to stress, while rates during compactive creep exhibit an insensitivity to stress indicative of the operation of crystal plasticity, in agreement with elastic wave velocity evolution and microstructural observations.},

abstract = {Abstract Because measuring the frequency dependence of elastic properties in the laboratory is a technical challenge, not enough experimental data exist to test the existing theories. We report measurements of three fluid-saturated sandstones over a broad frequency band: Wilkenson, Berea, and Bentheim sandstones. Those sandstones samples, chosen for their variable porosities and mineral content, are saturated by fluids of varying viscosities. The samples elastic response (Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio) and hydraulic response (fluid flow out of the sample) are measured as a function of frequency. Large dispersion and attenuation phenomena are observed over the investigated frequency range. For all samples, the variation at lowest frequency relates to a large fluid flow directly measured out of the rock samples. These are the cause (i.e., fluid flow) and consequence (i.e., dispersion/attenuation) of the transition between drained and undrained regimes. Consistently, the characteristic frequency correlates with permeability for each sandstone. Beyond this frequency, a second variation is observed for all samples, but the rocks behave differently. For Berea sandstone, an onset of dispersion/attenuation is expected from both Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio at highest frequency. For Bentheim and Wilkenson sandstones, however, only Young's modulus shows dispersion/attenuation phenomena. For Wilkenson sandstone, the viscoelastic-like dispersion/attenuation response is interpreted as squirt flow. For Bentheim sandstone, the second effect does not fully follow such response, which could be due to a lower accuracy in the measured attenuation or to the occurence of another physical effect in this rock sample.},

abstract = {Abstract The dispersion and the attenuation of the elastic moduli of a Lavoux limestone have been measured over a large frequency range: 10−3 Hz to 101 Hz and 1 MHz. The studied sample comes from a Dogger outcrop of Paris Basin and has the particularity to have a bimodal porosity distribution, with an equal proportion of intragranular microporosity and intergranular macroporosity. In addition to ultrasonic measurements, two different stress-strain methods have been used in a triaxial cell to derive all the elastic moduli at various differential pressures. The first method consists of hydrostatic stress oscillations (f∈[0.004;0.4] Hz), using the confining pressure pump, from which the bulk modulus was deduced. The second method consists of axial oscillations (f∈[0.01;10] Hz), using a piezoelectric oscillator on top of the sample, from which Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio were deduced. With the assumption of an isotropic medium, the bulk modulus (K) and the shear modulus (G) can also be computed from the axial oscillations. The sample was studied under dry, glycerin- and water-saturated conditions, in order to scale frequency by the viscosity of the fluid. Results show a dispersion at around 200 Hz for water-saturated conditions, affecting all the moduli except the shear modulus. This dispersion is related to the drained/undrained transition, and the bulk modulus deduced from the axial and hydrostatic oscillations are consistent with each other and with Biot-Gassmann's equations. No dispersion has been detected beyond that frequency. This was interpreted as the absence of squirt flow or local diffusion between the microporous oolites and the macropores.},

In carbonate rocks among others, low-temperature deformation can either occur with dilatancy or compaction, having implications for porosity changes, failure and petrophysical properties. Hence, a thorough understanding of all the micromechanisms responsible for deformation is of great interest. In this study, a constitutive model for the low-temperature deformation of low-porosity (\\&lt;20 per cent) carbonate rocks is derived from the micromechanisms identified in previous studies. The micromechanical model is based on (1) brittle crack propagation, (2) a plasticity law (interpreted in terms of dislocation glide without possibility to climb) for porous media with hardening and (3) crack nucleation due to dislocation pile-ups. The model predicts stress–strain relations and the evolution of damage during deformation. The model adequately predicts brittle behaviour at low confining pressures, which switches to a semi-brittle behaviour characterized by inelastic compaction followed by dilatancy at higher confining pressures. Model predictions are compared to experimental results from previous studies and are found to be in close agreement with experimental results. This suggests that microphysical phenomena responsible for the deformation are sufficiently well captured by the model although twinning, recovery and cataclasis are not considered. The porosity range of applicability and limits of the model are discussed.}",

abstract = {Abstract Over the last decades, a large understanding has been gained on the elastic properties of rocks. Rocks are, however, porous materials, which properties depend on both response of the bulk material and of the pores. Because in that case both the applied external pressure and the fluid pressure play a role, different poroelasticity coefficients exist. While theoretical relations exist, measuring precisely those different coefficients remains an experimental challenge. Accounting for the different experimental complexities, a new methodology is designed that allows attaining accurately a large set of compressibility and poroelasticity coefficients in porous and permeable rocks. This new method relies on the use of forced confining or pore fluid pressure oscillations. In total, seven independent coefficients have been measured using three different boundary conditions. Because the usual theories predict only four independent coefficients, this overdetermined set of data can be checked against existing thermodynamic relations. Measurements have been performed on a Bentheim sandstone under, water- and glycerine-saturated conditions for different values of confining and pore fluid pressure. Consistently with the poroelasticity theory, the effect of the fluid bulk modulus is observed under undrained conditions but not under drained ones. Using thermodynamic relations, (i) the unjacketed, quartz, and skeleton (Zimmerman's relation) bulk moduli fit, (ii) the drained and undrained properties fit, and (iii) it is directly inferred from the measurements that the pore skeleton compressibility Cϕ is expected to be constant with pressure and to be exceedingly near the bulk skeleton Cs and mineral Cm compressibility coefficients.},
